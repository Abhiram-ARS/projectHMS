Final Year Project (Higher secondary)

In Hospital Management system, I have developed a secure, user-friendly contactless software prototype with command based interface using Python-MySQL connectivity. This system will help the hospitals to manage and provide hassle free service of a hospital for the user. This system is completely secure and Hospitals can make their needs through this system. Moreover, it is completely contactless.
